# Category Management

![Category management screenshot](/img/features/categories.png)

Categories in Periodix-Planner allow you to organize and track your time investments across different areas of your life.

## 🎯 Overview

Categories are the foundation of the time budgeting system. They represent different areas where you invest your time:

- **Work** - Professional activities
- **Health** - Exercise, wellness, self-care
- **Learning** - Education, skill development
- **Relationships** - Family, friends, social activities
- **Personal Projects** - Hobbies, creative pursuits

## 🎨 Creating Categories

### In Settings

1. Go to **Settings** → **Periodix-Planner** → **Categories** tab
2. Click **Add Category**
3. Enter a category name
4. Choose a color for visual identification
5. Click **Save**

### Category Properties

- **Name** - Unique identifier for the category
- **Color** - Hex color code (e.g., `#3B82F6`)
- **ID** - Auto-generated unique identifier

## 📊 Using Categories

### In Time Budgets

Categories appear in:
- Time budget code blocks
- Allocation editor
- Visual statistics
- Budget tracking

### Allocation

Allocate time to categories:
- Set hours per category
- Track across time periods
- Monitor budget status
- View visual breakdowns

## 📈 Global Statistics

The Categories tab in settings displays comprehensive statistics across all your top-level periodic notes (yearly, quarterly, monthly, weekly, or daily depending on what you have enabled).

### Statistics Table

View a complete breakdown showing:
- **Category** - Name with color indicator
- **Notes** - Number of periodic notes using this category
- **Total Hours** - Sum of hours allocated to this category
- **Percentage** - Proportion of total time allocation

### Visual Pie Chart

An interactive pie chart visualizes your time allocation:
- Color-coded by category
- Hover for detailed tooltips
- Shows hours and percentages
- Automatically updates when allocations change

### How It Works

Global statistics aggregate data from your top-level period type:
- If yearly notes are enabled, statistics aggregate from all yearly notes
- If yearly is disabled but quarterly is enabled, statistics use quarterly notes
- Continues down the hierarchy to find the top enabled period type
- Updates automatically when you change time allocations

## 🔄 Managing Categories

### Editing

1. Go to **Settings** → **Periodix-Planner** → **Categories**
2. Click on a category
3. Modify name or color
4. Save changes

### Deleting

**⚠️ Warning**: Deleting a category removes it from all allocations. Consider:
- Reviewing affected periods first
- Reallocating time to other categories
- Backing up allocations if needed
